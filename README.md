# Module 4 API Workshop

## Overview

The repo shows how .NET 6 is used to create APIs.

Before running the sample code, download the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) for testing the APIs.

### 1. Minimal API

This is a new feature in .NET 6 that allows developers to skip a lot of the boilerplate code used to create .NET Web APIs. Seeing an API without the extra plumbing should help in understanding the middleware and controllers used in traditional .NET Web APIs.

1. Switch to the `1-minimal-api` branch in VS Code.
1. Start the API by running `dotnet run`.
1. Test the API by using the _test.http_ file.
